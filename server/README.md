## Problems

1. How to handle authentication
How to know if a user is logged in or not?
if user does not have valid cookie -> not logged in
if user have valid cookie -> logged in

what is a valid cookie? -> a cookie is valid if it is in session db
what information to send to the client and get back to know which
user is this? -> user _id . It ok to see, but what if client create 
cookie with random _id? -> only _id in session collection is valid.
how to know when to delete session? -> logout API. What if user do
not use logout? -> when user close browser, session cookie gone,
need to login again -> what if there is a seesion in db, and user
logged in again, there will be 2 session. -> solution: set expire 
for session in db. 

Procedure
for private route check if logged in or not. if not send to login
else display cookie data.
session db have hash: id + username hash with secret salt, id,
expire.
use salt to decode hash, use id to identify user.
